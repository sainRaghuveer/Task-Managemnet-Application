# Task-management-application

## About
 - This project is a simple task management application built with Next.js and TypeScript and Tailwind css. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, and displays the tasks in a list with options to edit and delete each task.

## Getting Started

 - First go inside root directory of your project and then clone this repository into your local system 
```js
https://github.com/sainRaghuveer/Task-Managemnet-Application.git
```
 - Install all dependencies using the following command

```js
npm install
```


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Usage

 - Start the development server:
 ```bash
 npm start
 ```

 - Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the app.
 - Use the input form on the left side of the page to add new tasks.
 - Click the "Edit" button next to a task to make changes to its title, description, or status.
 - Click the "Save" button to save the changes or the "Cancel" button to discard them.
 - Click the "Delete" button to remove a task from the list.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
